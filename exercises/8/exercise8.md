# Exercise 8

_“Cyberspace. A consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators, in every nation, by children being taught mathematical concepts... A graphic representation of data abstracted from banks of every computer in the human system. Unthinkable complexity. Lines of light ranged in the nonspace of the mind, clusters and constellations of data. Like city lights, receding...”_
― William Gibson, Neuromancer

Put on your mirrorshades, console cowboy.  You're about to punch deck and crack through the blackest ice in cyberspace. _*_

All you have to do is enter the secret word and untold riches (or at least some extra credit) are yours.

You may work with a partner or by yourself (but if you work with a partner, you split the extra credit).

This is an in-class exercise.  I will post the link here (along with the correct answer for each class) AFTER all of the classes have finished.

## Instructions

Point your Ono-Sendai Cyberspace 7 console (or web browser) to the site given to you by the instructor.

Enter the secret word.

How do you figure it out?  That's up to you.

## Hints

1. The password is an actual English word, although it may or may not be a common one.
2. That's it.

# GRADING

If you are the FIRST group to come up with the secret word and demonstrate it to me by the END OF CLASS, you will get 1.0 point of extra credit for the course (if you are working with a partner, you each get +0.5).  In other words, if you have an 89.0 in the class, and you are the first person to enter the secret word, your final grade would be 90.0 (89.0 + 1).

If you are NOT the first group but still come up with the secret word, your group gets +0.4 extra credit (if you are working with a partner, you each get +0.2).
